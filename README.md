# Book-List

## Description
A list of programming books, built using React and Bootstrap components.

## How to Run
1. Clone and download the repository, save the files to your PC
2. Navigate to the root folder within the terminal
3. Run npm install and npx http-server -c-1
4. From there, the app will open in your browser!

## Future Improvements
I would like to further improve the styling and appearance, as well as add some additional features, like a drop down menu to access each book.
